// Manages a single rate limit policy, which may apply to multiple endpoints.
//
// The policy pump (network-redesign spec, D3): a plain deque of entries and
// an on-demand drain coroutine — one linear loop (take, pace, gate, send,
// maybe retry, deliver) instead of the old timer-and-signal state machine.
// The 429 retry is a loop iteration: invisible to the caller, who sees
// exactly one final completion (the F57 wedge is unconstructible).
//
// Completion is a QFuture<FetchOutcome> (D1): body bytes on success, a
// FetchError value otherwise. Every entry's promise reaches a final state —
// payload, error, or Canceled — so awaiting is unconditionally safe (D2/ER1).
