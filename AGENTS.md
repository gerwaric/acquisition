# Repository Guidelines

## Project Map
- Acquisition is a C++23 Qt Widgets application for Path of Exile stash, inventory, and forum shop management.
- `src/` contains the application code. Important subdirectories include `src/datastore/`, `src/legacy/`, `src/poe/`, `src/ratelimit/`, `src/repoe/`, `src/ui/`, and `src/util/`.
- `assets/` contains bundled icons and Path of Exile-style UI images.
- `docs/` contains design specs, ADRs, and the findings register; `docs/README.md` maps them.
- `deps/qdarkstyle/` is the vendored qdarkstyle dependency. Other third-party libraries are fetched by CMake.
- Release packaging is defined in `.github/workflows/`.

## Build And Run
- Read `BUILD.md` before changing build, packaging, or platform setup.
- Configure and build with `cmake -S . -B build` and `cmake --build build`.
- CMake requires Qt 6.11+, the Qt Network Authorization module, and the private Qt Gui module that the fetched QXlsx dependency links against. Linux also requires OpenSSL.
- A distribution's Qt packages often ship neither of those modules, so a bare `cmake -S . -B build` can pick up a system Qt and fail in `build/_deps/qxlsx-src` with `Failed to find required Qt component "GuiPrivate"`. Point CMake at an official Qt kit instead: `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<qt-install>/6.11.1/<compiler>`.
- If `build/` already holds Qt Creator kit trees (`build/Desktop_Qt_6_11_1_Release` and similar), build and test in one of those rather than configuring a second tree at `build/` itself.
- Run locally with `./build/acquisition --data-dir /tmp/acq-data` to avoid touching a user's real Acquisition data.
- Run the checked-in Qt Test suite with `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` after building.

## Items Pipeline and Network Redesign (in progress)
- The July 2026 interior design cleanup is complete. Current work is a delta-native redesign of the items refresh pipeline; read `docs/design/items-pipeline.md` before making structural changes to the worker, `ItemsManager`, or the search/model refresh paths.
- The rate-limited networking layer is being redesigned under an accepted, frozen spec; read `docs/design/network-redesign.md` before touching `src/ratelimit/` or the network boundary. Claims about how the Path of Exile API actually limits requests live in `docs/design/network-ground-truth.md` and are cited by number.
- Known design/correctness problems are recorded in `docs/cleanup/findings.md` (open findings, standing constraints, and a ledger of resolved ones). Check it before fixing something that looks broken — it may already be recorded or assigned.
- A rewrite-or-evolve decision for the core and UI is under exploration: see `docs/adr/0003-rewrite-vs-evolve.md` (proposed) and the `redesign` branch (`docs/redesign/`). Until that ADR is accepted, nothing changes — the specs above remain full authority for all work on `master`.

## Development Guidance
- Use `.clang-format` for C++ formatting when touching formatted source, respect existing `// clang-format off/on` blocks, and preserve nearby style for naming and code organization.
- Prefer existing Qt and local helper patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep generated logs, `settings.ini`, OAuth tokens, and other user-local state out of commits.
- For release changes, compare `CMakeLists.txt`, `installer.iss`, and the relevant workflow so version and packaging assumptions stay aligned.
