# Settings and troubleshooting

## Refreshing items

The **Tabs** menu:

| Item | What it does |
|---|---|
| Fetch tabs list | Downloads the list of stash tabs and characters only, without their contents |
| Refresh checked tabs | Downloads the tabs and characters whose check box in the item list is ticked |
| Refresh all tabs | Downloads everything |
| Auto refresh checked tabs | Checkable; repeats *Refresh checked tabs* on a timer |
| Auto refresh interval... | Sets that timer in minutes |
| Get map stashes / Get unique stashes | Checkable; also download the sub-tabs of Map and Unique stash tabs |

Right-click one or more tabs in the item list and choose **Refresh Selected** to
update just those. Tabs whose price is set in the game are always refreshed.

Items already on disk are shown immediately at startup; the refresh replaces
them tab by tab as downloads finish.

## Rate limiting

The Path of Exile API limits how fast Acquisition may fetch. Acquisition reads the
limits the API sends back and paces itself, so a large account simply takes a
while. The status bar button reads **Rate Limit Status** normally, or
*Rate limited for N seconds* while waiting. Clicking it opens the
**Rate Limit Status Window**, which lists each policy and rule with its current
hits, limit, period, and timeout. Nothing here needs configuring; it exists so
you can see why a refresh is paused.

## Settings menu

- **Theme** — Dark, Light, or Default. Applied immediately.
- **Logging** — OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE. The default is
  INFO.
- **POESESSID** — Show or edit the session cookie used for forum posting.

## Logging

Log output goes to the **Event Log** panel at the bottom of the window and to
`log.txt` in the data directory. When reporting a problem, set the level to
DEBUG, reproduce it, and attach `log.txt`. You can also start with
`acquisition --log-level DEBUG`.

## Updates

Acquisition checks the GitHub releases at startup. When a newer version exists,
an **Update available** button appears in the status bar; clicking it opens the
download page. Pre-releases are offered separately from stable releases, and a
version you dismiss is not offered again.

## Crash reports

With **Report crashes** enabled on the login window, native crashes are sent to
the developer through Sentry. Reports contain a stack trace and the Acquisition
version; they do not include your item data.

## Files and where to find them

See [Getting started](getting-started.md#where-your-data-lives) for the data
directory. Deleting `data/` forces a full re-download and loses your buyouts;
deleting `cache/` only loses cached item images; `settings.ini` holds the
options from the login window and the menus.

## Common problems

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| *Error requesting leagues* on the login window | The API is unreachable; check your connection or proxy |
| Login button stays disabled | You have not authenticated, or no league is selected |
| Refresh seems stuck | Open the Rate Limit Status Window; the API is probably throttling |
| *No forum threads have been set* | Set a thread under **Shop → Forum shop thread…** |
| *POESESSID has not been set* / rejected | Enter a fresh cookie under **Shop → Update shop POESESSID** |
| Cannot change a price | The price comes from the game (tab name or item note); change it there |
| Windows: crash at startup in `MSVCP140.dll` | Install the Visual C++ runtime the installer offers |
