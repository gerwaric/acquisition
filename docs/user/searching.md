# Searching

## The main window

From top to bottom:

- **Search tabs.** Each tab is an independent search with its own filters. The
  trailing **+** tab creates a new one. Tab captions show the search name and the
  number of matching items, e.g. `Rings [42]`. Right-click a tab for
  **Rename Tab** and **Delete Tab**; middle-click closes a tab.
- **Search form.** Text fields, drop-downs, min/max ranges, and check boxes,
  grouped under *Offense*, *Defense*, *Sockets*, *Requirements*, *Misc*, and
  *Mods*. Searches update as you type.
- **View selector.** *By Tab* groups items under the stash tab or character they
  came from; *By Item* is a flat list.
- **Item list.** A tree of tabs/characters and their items. The check box on a
  tab or character controls whether it is included in **Refresh checked tabs**.
  Right-click for **Refresh Selected**, **Check Selected**, **Uncheck Selected**,
  **Check All**, **Uncheck All**, **Expand All**, and **Collapse All**.
- **Buyout controls** under the list — see [Pricing](pricing.md).
- **Item panel** on the right: the item's name, an in-game-style **Tooltip** tab,
  a plain **Text** tab, and **Hide**. **Upload to imgur** uploads the rendered
  tooltip and copies the URL to the clipboard; **Copy for Path of Building**
  copies the item in Path of Building's *Create custom* format.
- **Status bar** with the current activity, a **Rate Limit Status** button, and
  an **Update available** button when a newer release exists.
- **Event Log** at the bottom. Collapsed by default; its button changes to
  *N error(s)* or *N warning(s)* when something needs attention.
