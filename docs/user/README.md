# Acquisition User Guide

Acquisition downloads your Path of Exile stash tabs and character inventories so
you can search them offline, price items, and publish those prices to forum shop
threads that the official trade site indexes.

Acquisition is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by Grinding Gear Games.

## Sixty-second overview

1. Launch Acquisition and click **Authenticate**. A browser window opens for the
   Path of Exile OAuth grant. Pick a realm and league, then click **Login**.
2. Acquisition loads whatever it already has cached, then fetches your stash tab
   list and downloads the checked tabs and characters.
3. Use the search form at the top of the window to filter items. Each search
   lives in its own tab; click **+** to open another.
4. Select an item or a tab and set a price with the buyout controls under the
   item list.
5. To advertise those prices, set a forum shop thread and a POESESSID under the
   **Shop** menu, then choose **Update forum shop(s)**.

## A note on this guide

Acquisition is mature software that is being replaced by a from-scratch rewrite,
so this guide is intentionally short and written from the source code rather than
from screenshots. Menu and dialog names are quoted exactly as they appear in the
application. If something here disagrees with the program, the program wins —
please open an issue so the page can be corrected.
