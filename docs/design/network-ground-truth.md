# Network Ground Truth

**Status: living research document, begun July 17, 2026.** This is the
output of the network ground-truth research phase that paused the F56–F59
fix work (see `docs/cleanup/findings.md` and the pause note in F56). Its
job is to capture everything we know, believe, or need to learn about how
Path of Exile's API actually limits requests — so that queueing/scheduling
designs can be derived from cited claims instead of code archaeology and
folklore. When a claim here falls, every design that cites it falls with
it; that is the point.

Rules of this document:

- **Claims are numbered N1, N2, … and never renumbered.** Designs and
  specs cite them by number.
- Every claim carries a **source tag** and a **confidence**. When better
  evidence lands (a verbatim email, an instrumented log), the claim is
  upgraded in place with the new citation — history stays in git.
- Hypotheses and open questions live here too, clearly marked. A
  hypothesis is a claim we are *acting on* without adequate evidence; an
  open question is one we have not resolved either way.

## The four-layer model

The API's request limiting is not one mechanism. Four distinct layers
exist, and only one of them is documented:

1. **Cloudflare / DDoS protection** — in front of everything, opaque
   even to GGG support, IP-facing, triggered by request *bursts*.
2. **Policy counters** — the documented `X-Rate-Limit-*` contract:
   named policies, rules, hit counters, restrictions, `Retry-After`.
3. **Timing buckets** — server-side quantization of the policy
   counters. Real, GGG-confirmed, deliberately not exposed to clients.
4. **Behavioral enforcement** — humans at GGG: the documented threat of
   application revocation for frequent violations, and privately granted
   allowances (HEAD probing) that exist only in email.

A correct client design must satisfy all four at once. The layers have
different failure modes: layer 1 blocks the user's IP outside the API's
own protocol; layer 2 returns structured 429s; layer 3 makes layer 2
fire "impossibly"; layer 4 kills the application id for everyone.

---

## Design postulates

Two conclusions strong enough to drive design, derived from the claims
below:

**P-A. Perfect violation prevention is impossible; graceful 429 recovery
is therefore a first-class requirement, not edge-case handling.**
The timing buckets (N11–N14) quantize the server's counters in ways the
headers do not expose, GGG says bucket sizes "might" vary and can only
be learned by asking support per policy, and limits are documented as
dynamic (N9). The client's model of the server counter is *inherently*
approximate. Occasional violations are a structural fact of the
platform. Consequence: F57 (one 429 wedges the update until restart) is
not a rare-path bug — under this postulate it is a violation of a core
requirement. Even the recovery path is bucket-quantized: `Retry-After`
likely needs padding too (N19). Cites: N9, N11, N12, N13, N14, N15,
N19.

**P-B. Parallelism across policies is safe at the policy layer, but
must be packaged with a deliberate global burst bound.**
The four data endpoints have four independent policies whose counters
run in parallel (N6, N7) — so cross-policy parallel requests do not
violate layer 2. But layer 1 watches burst concurrency invisibly (N2,
N4): the one known Cloudflare block was triggered by over a thousand
requests in a minute, and policy-compliant traffic is inherently slow
("seconds-per-request", N4), so a small in-flight cap plus strict HEAD
serialization (N18) is what keeps layer 1 invisible. Any design that
re-parallelizes (the F56 fix) must state its global bound explicitly.
Cites: N2, N4, N6, N7, N18.

## Claims ledger

### Layer 1 — Cloudflare / DDoS protection

**N1. A Cloudflare protection layer sits in front of the API; its rules
are opaque even to GGG support.** [INCIDENT + TOM — Confirmed]
Discovered via the incident in N2. The affected user knew a GGG
developer personally and escalated; the resulting exchanges established
that GGG support itself does not know the layer's details.

**N2. The one known Cloudflare block (July 2024, v0.11.1-alpha.11) was
triggered by over a thousand HEAD requests in one minute — redundant
per-tab probes, repeated ~20+ times per stash tab.** [INCIDENT +
GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
GGG support relayed the report, verbatim (July 2024):

> "Just letting you know that someone has come to us after getting
> rate-limited by cloudflare after using your tool. It made over a
> thousand requests in a minute, all were HEAD requests to what seems
> like every Standard stash tab on the account at least 20 times each.
> Hopefully this isn't the intended behaviour... so passing it along
> for you to look into."

The client was firing one HEAD per stash tab even though all tabs
share one endpoint — a single HEAD would have sufficed. The trigger
was a burst of redundant requests, not sustained rate. The fix Tom
shipped later that month is the origin of the current HEAD design and
the F5 standing constraint (one-HEAD-at-a-time, nested event loop in
`RateLimiter::SetupEndpoint`). The affected user (around since 2014,
personally acquainted with a GGG developer) escalated, which is also
how N1's "opaque even to GGG support" was learned. Remaining unknown:
the block from the user's side — presentation, duration, scope (Q7).

**N3. Cloudflare signals such blocks with error code 1015, which
Cloudflare documents as caused by (but not limited to) rate limit
violations.** [TOM + Cloudflare public docs — High]
The client already watches for 1015 in the league-list fetch
(`logindialog.cpp`).

**N4. A client that respects the policy limits and avoids request
bursts should never surface the Cloudflare layer.** [TOM reasoning —
HYP, Provisional]
Tom's framing: GGG's limits are effectively "seconds per request", not
"requests per second" — compliant traffic is slow. If layer 2 is
implemented well and bursts are bounded, layer 1 stays invisible.
Strategy consequence: we deliberately do **not** try to characterize
the Cloudflare boundary (probing it risks real users' IPs); we stay far
inside it. The only design obligation layer 1 imposes is the burst
bound of P-B.

### Layer 2 — Policy counters (the documented contract)

**N5. The header contract is: `X-Rate-Limit-Policy` (policy name),
`X-Rate-Limit-Rules` (comma-list of rule names),
`X-Rate-Limit-<rule>` (comma-list of `hits:period:restriction`
triplets), `X-Rate-Limit-<rule>-State` (comma-list of
`current-hits:period:restriction-active` triplets), and `Retry-After`
(seconds) on 429 responses.** [DOC — Confirmed]
The client's parsing (`src/ratelimit/ratelimit.cpp`,
`ratelimitpolicy.cpp`) matches this format. Docs: applications should
"parse and follow" these headers.

**N6. Policies with the same name share counters across endpoints;
differently-named policies count independently and in parallel.**
[DOC (same-name sharing) + TOM (parallel counting) — Confirmed]
Docs: "Policies may be the same across different API endpoints but are
treated the same for rate limiting purposes." Tom confirms the
counters for different policies run in parallel. This is the premise
that makes F56 (accidental cross-policy serialization) a real defect
rather than conservative correctness.

**N7. The four data endpoints acquisition uses map to four distinct
policies: `stash-list-request-limit`, `stash-request-limit`,
`character-list-request-limit`, `character-request-limit`.**
[GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
These four names come from Tom's email to GGG support (quoted under
N12), and GGG answered in terms of them without correction. Together
with N6, full four-way parallelism is safe at layer 2.

**N8. Rules within a policy can be IP-, account-, or client-scoped.**
[DOC — Confirmed (that these scopes exist)]
Open (Q2): whether the policy/rule topology differs between OAuth
sessions (client-scoped?) and POESESSID sessions (account/IP-scoped?),
and what that implies for a user running acquisition alongside the
website or other tools.

**N9. Limits are dynamic and can change at any time.** [DOC —
Confirmed]
Docs verbatim: "These limits are dynamic and can change at any time
depending on our requirements." The client must tolerate mid-session
policy changes (the `RateLimitPolicy::Check` machinery exists for
this; today a mismatch only logs). Tempering observation (TOM, July
2026): the policy definitions acquisition sees have not changed since
Tom first observed them — years of stability. The reservation is real
but rarely, if ever, exercised.

**N10. Frequently exceeding the limits results in application access
being revoked.** [DOC — Confirmed (that the threat exists)]
Docs verbatim: "Exceeding these limits frequently will result in your
application access being revoked." Acquisition is a registered
confidential client (`client_id=acquisition`), so this is an
application-wide, all-users consequence. What "frequently" means is
unknown (Q8). This is also why active 429-provoking experiments are
ruled out as a research method.

### Layer 3 — Timing buckets

**N11. The server buckets incoming requests into time intervals; the
counters the headers report are quantized by these buckets, which are
not exposed to clients.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
GGG support, verbatim (on one policy, before the four-policy answer):

> "That particular policy has a resolution of 5 seconds, which means
> that it buckets incoming requests in 5 second intervals. To be safe
> you'd have to add 5 more seconds rather than 2. This isn't exposed
> anywhere for you to have known and we'll have to figure out some way
> of making that more obvious... in the meantime feel free to ask about
> other policies and we can track down what resolution they use for
> you."

**N12. For all four policies in N7: the initial (short-period) limit is
bucketed in 5-second intervals; the sustained (long-period) limit is
bucketed in 1-minute intervals.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed, as of the
email date]
Tom asked GGG support for the resolution of exactly those four
policies. GGG support, verbatim:

> "They are all bucketed in 5 second intervals for the initial limit,
> and then 1 minute intervals for the sustained limit."

GGG had earlier said resolutions "might" vary per endpoint, so this
answer is per-policy fact, not a global rule — and per N9 it could
change. Provenance note: this email is the direct source of
`INITIAL_TIMING_BUCKET_SECS = 5` and `SUSTAINED_TIMING_BUCKET_SECS =
60` in `src/ratelimit/ratelimitpolicy.cpp`, which until this document
had no written provenance. (The `INITIAL_VS_SUSTAINED_PERIOD_CUTOFF =
75` used to classify a limit as initial-vs-sustained is a client-side
heuristic calibrated by eyeballing the observed policy definitions,
not from GGG — see Q4 for provenance and an untested alternative.)

**N13. The safe margin against bucket quantization is the full bucket
size, added on top of the computed wait.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
From the N11 quote: "To be safe you'd have to add 5 more seconds rather
than 2." The current client adds bucket + 1s
(`TIMING_BUCKET_BUFFER_SECS`).

**N14. Bucket resolutions can only be learned by asking GGG support per
policy; there is no protocol mechanism.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
GGG explicitly offered "feel free to ask about other policies and we
can track down what resolution they use for you." If new endpoints are
ever added (or Q3 suggests a change), this is the channel.

**N15. Before the buckets were known, sub-second pacing arithmetic
produced intermittent, undiagnosable rate limit violations.**
[TOM/INCIDENT — Confirmed]
This is the empirical face of P-A: the violations were real, the
client-side arithmetic was "correct", and the cause was invisible by
construction. Open (Q5): whether the current bucket-padded pacing has
reduced live violations to zero, or whether a residual rate remains —
the violation counter exists because violations were still being
observed. Instrumented sessions will answer this.

### Layer 4 — Sanctions and private allowances

**N16. HEAD probing is sanctioned by GGG — "intended to work" — with
the sanctioned usage pattern being a single HEAD at application
startup. All of this exists only in a private email thread (Nov 2023 –
Jul 2024); the docs say nothing.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]

Chronology, verbatim:

- **Nov 2023** — Tom asks whether OAuth HEADs need a special scope
  (they worked on legacy endpoints but failed on the new API with an
  "insufficient scope" error). GGG, a few days later:

  > "Unfortunately an oversight has prevented this from working for
  > quite some time... I'm surprised you're the first person to bring
  > it up! It is intended to work as you'd expected and we'll get a
  > fix out for it in the next game patch."

- **Dec 2023** — Tom reports that a HEAD against
  `/character/<name>` returns `x-rate-limit-policy` but none of the
  other rate-limit headers. GGG (Feb 2024): "Things are a bit hectic
  this year! I've identified the issue and we should be able to get a
  fix out for it next patch."

- **Apr 2024** — Tom asks for a recommended rate limit for HEADs,
  including possible periodic UI-refresh polling. GGG, a few days
  later:

  > "Ideally you only need to make one HEAD request to figure out what
  > state you're in as the application boots up. Is there a reason you
  > think the policy state would get out of sync enough to warrant it?
  > Such as after being rate-limited?"

- **Jul 2024** — the Cloudflare incident (N2); the fix that month
  produced the current one-HEAD-at-a-time design.

Reading: the sanction is real but *narrow* — one HEAD at boot to
discover unknown state. Periodic polling was met with a question, not
an endorsement; treat it as unsanctioned. Note that GGG's own reply
floats HEAD-after-429 resync as a conceivably legitimate case ("Such
as after being rate-limited?") — a door left open, not a grant.
Standing consequence: the technique is legitimate but fragile — the
sanction is invisible to any future maintainer or GGG employee who
has not seen this thread, which is part of why it is transcribed
here.

**N17. Acquisition was — per GGG — the first client to raise HEAD
probing on the new API; API behavior in this area has had real,
long-lived bugs.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
GGG, Nov 2023: "I'm surprised you're the first person to bring it up!"
— about an oversight that had "prevented this from working for quite
some time." Tom has also personally found documented API object fields
that were simply wrong. Consequence for research method: community
prior art is a calibration source, not ground truth — other projects
likely never exercised these paths. See N20 for the design consequence
of the bug history.

**N18. HEAD probes must be strictly serialized — at most one in flight,
ever.** [INCIDENT + CODE — Confirmed as a constraint we impose]
Direct lesson of N2, implemented as the F5 nested-event-loop block in
`RateLimiter::SetupEndpoint`. Today's accidental full serialization
(F56) makes overlap impossible; any re-parallelization must preserve
this property deliberately (noted in the F56 pause note).

**N19. `Retry-After` alone is probably insufficient — the retried
request likely needs bucket padding on top.** [TOM — Provisional]
Tom is "almost certain" of this from his launch-window experimentation,
where the retry delay was one of the variables tuned against
intermittent violations. If confirmed (Q9), the F57 fix must schedule
the retried request at `Retry-After` plus the applicable bucket, not
`Retry-After` alone. Strengthens P-A: even the recovery path is
subject to bucket quantization.

**N20. HEAD responses are intended to carry the full rate-limit header
set — and this mechanism has silently regressed server-side at least
twice.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed]
The Nov 2023 "insufficient scope" oversight and the Dec 2023
`/character/<name>` HEAD returning only `x-rate-limit-policy` (see the
N16 chronology) were both server-side breakages of exactly the
mechanism the client's startup depends on — each live for an extended
period, each fixed only after Tom reported it. Design consequence: the
client must degrade gracefully when a HEAD comes back partial. Today
`RateLimiter::ProcessHeadResponse` is fatal only on a missing
`X-Rate-Limit-Policy`. **Correction (July 18, 2026, by code trace
during the redesign review):** this claim previously said a
Dec-2023-shaped reply (policy present, rules absent) would parse into
an empty policy and run effectively unpaced — wrong. A missing header
parses to a one-element `[""]` list (Qt `split` on an empty array),
passes the only size check in `RateLimitRule`, and `RateLimitData`
indexes `parts[1]` out of bounds (`ratelimitpolicy.cpp:52`) —
undefined behavior/crash, not unpaced running. The redesign's
validation front-end removes the path
(`docs/design/network-redesign.md`, D8); the degraded-HEAD design
decision itself is made there too (D4 — a degraded probe fails its
endpoint's requests cleanly under a cooldown; the July 19
simplification chose clean failure over a discovery fallback),
closing the Q3 residual.

### Other regimes — legacy website API and forum

Acquisition's traffic is not all OAuth-API traffic. Two other regimes
exist, with mutually exclusive auth. Design-history note (Tom, July
2026): this multi-regime reality — two hosts, incompatible auth, two
different limit-signaling protocols — is part of why the current
architecture centralizes scheduling and policy management inside the
rate limiter. Recorded as context for the M2 where-does-scheduling-live
question, not as an endorsement either way.

**N21. The legacy website API
(`www.pathofexile.com/character-window/*`) is rate-limited by the same
`X-Rate-Limit-*` header mechanism as the OAuth API, works only with
POESESSID auth, and actively rejects requests that carry an OAuth
bearer token.** [TOM — Confirmed, as of July 2026]
Consequences: (a) auth must be scoped per host — a bearer token must
never reach `www.pathofexile.com` (the current
`NetworkManager::createRequest` already restricts the bearer to
`api.pathofexile.com`, correct by construction, but nothing pins this
as a requirement); (b) GGG's bucket answer (N12) named only the four
`api.pathofexile.com` policies — the legacy endpoints' bucket
resolutions are unknown (the N14 ask-GGG channel applies); (c) open:
whether legacy policies share names/counters with the OAuth stash
policies (observable from the captured `X-Rate-Limit-Policy` on
`get-stash-items`).

**N22. The forum (`/forum/edit-thread/*`) is a separate rate-limiting
regime: no `X-Rate-Limit-*` protocol, limits signaled in the response
HTML ("You must wait N seconds."), POESESSID-only, and it also breaks
if an OAuth bearer token is present.** [TOM + CODE — Confirmed]
The client detects limits by scraping the body and resubmitting
(`Shop::OnShopSubmitted`), entirely outside the rate limiter. It
shares the user's IP, so layer 1 sees this traffic regardless of how
separate the protocol is.

### First capture — observed claims (July 18, 2026)

Source for all claims in this group: the first instrumented session
[OBS — Confirmed for this session; one account, OAuth auth, PC realm],
July 18, 2026: full refresh of 121 stash fetches (~47 top-level +
folder/special children) plus one shop stash-index call and one
character. 132 records, zero errors, zero violations. Capture file
retained locally (not committed — it contains account/stash
identifiers).

**N23. Observed policy topology and definitions (OAuth session).**
Five policies, confirming N7's four plus a distinct legacy policy:

| Policy | Rules | Limits (`hits:period:restriction`) |
|---|---|---|
| `stash-list-request-limit` | Account | `10:15:60, 30:60:300` |
| `stash-request-limit` | Account | `15:10:60, 30:300:300` |
| `character-list-request-limit` | Account | `2:10:60, 5:300:300` |
| `character-request-limit` | Account | `5:10:60, 30:300:300` |
| `backend-item-request-limit` (legacy `get-stash-items`) | Account, Ip | Account `30:60:60, 100:1800:600`; Ip `45:60:120, 180:1800:600` |

Under OAuth the API rules are all **Account**-scoped (no Client rule
observed — so other tools on the same account share these counters).
The legacy endpoint has its own policy — **no counter sharing with
`stash-request-limit`** (answers N21c) — and is the only one with an
Ip rule.

**N24. HEAD probes return the full header set and do not appear to
increment the counters.** API HEADs returned **204** (legacy: 200)
with complete limits+state+rules — the Dec 2023 regression (N16/N20)
is fixed. All four API states were `0` hits at HEAD time and the first
GET reported exactly `1`, so HEADs don't count against the policy.
The legacy policy's 1800s window showed 1 pre-existing hit at HEAD
time — confirmed by Tom as residue from an earlier acquisition
session. That residue is itself worth stating: **the counters are
server-side per account and persist across client restarts**, so a
freshly started client can begin mid-window with hits already
consumed — which is exactly why the HEAD-at-boot pattern (N16)
matters.

**N25. The state header is post-increment and tracks 1:1.** Each
reply's state included that request (first request = 1), incremented
exactly once per request through both windows, hit exactly `15/15` and
`30/30` at saturation and never over, and reset cleanly after the
padded wait. No bucket-quantization artifacts were *visible* — but at
full bucket padding none would be; the quantization only shows at
tighter margins (N15).

**N26. The client's pacing arithmetic is empirically exact, and the
resulting shape is burst-then-stall.** Observed cycle: 15 sends at
~0.2s spacing (10s window full) → wait ≈ 10+5+1s → 15 more sends
(300s window full) → wait ≈ 300+60+1s; the long-wait send landed
within 0.4s of `history[max_hits-1] + period + bucket + buffer`.
Cost of the padding: ~61s idle per 30-fetch cycle (~17% overhead);
121 tabs took ~24 minutes. Design note for later (not a finding):
even pacing at ~period/hits spacing would avoid saturation entirely —
no bucket stalls (~20% faster) and no 0.2s bursts (friendlier to
layer 1) — at the cost of never using the initial-burst allowance.
Also observed: the worker queue is not strictly stashes-first — the
character fetch (request id 54) sat behind only the ~47 initially
queued tabs, with ~74 children appended behind it as parents resolved
(refines F56's description).

### Rate-limit-core spike follow-up claims (August 15, 2026)

These claims were transcribed from CN1–CN6 in
`spikes/rate-limit-core/result-draft.md` on branch
`spike/rate-limit-core`. They survive or fall on their cited sources
independently of that spike's verdict.

**N27. Too many invalid requests in a short period restrict access;
the invalid-request budget includes every HTTP 4xx response, including
429, and its threshold parameters are undocumented.** [DOC —
Confirmed; retrieved August 9, 2026]
Official developer docs:
`https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/index`. A 429 therefore
spends both the violated rate-limit policy's budget and the separate
invalid-request budget. This extends the layer-4 revocation concern in
N10 with a distinct restriction mechanism whose threshold is unknown
(the sibling of Q8).

**N28. A Cloudflare layer-1 block can present as HTTP 403 with
`cf-mitigated: challenge`, rather than error 1015, and without
rate-limit headers.** [COMMUNITY — High for the reported incident;
retrieved August 9, 2026]
The public report is
`https://community.cloudflare.com/t/blocked-from-path-of-exile-api-but-not-allowed-to-contact-support/549055`.
This extends N3's client-side recognition surface; it does not claim
that every Cloudflare block has this shape.

**N29. Recourse for a layer-1 block can be asymmetric: the block may
be invisible to GGG support while Cloudflare support is unavailable to
a non-business user.** [COMMUNITY — High for the reported incident;
retrieved August 9, 2026]
The source is the same public report as N28:
`https://community.cloudflare.com/t/blocked-from-path-of-exile-api-but-not-allowed-to-contact-support/549055`.
This informs Q7; it is evidence from one reported incident, not a
universal support-policy claim.

**N30. Trade-API rules have been observed with three windows per rule;
the two-window `RulePair` shape is not universal.** [COMMUNITY — High
for the reported policy shape; community-observed February 2021,
retrieved August 9, 2026]
Source: `https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3056323`.
A policy whose rule has one or three windows is therefore out of the
spike model, not impossible.

**N31. N11–N13 do not specify the exact bucket-quantization boundary
semantics: when a hit's age is measured and exactly when it leaves a
window.** [SPIKE — Confirmed documentation gap; inferred model choice,
August 9, 2026]
The rate-limit-core mock adopts the most-adversarial consistent reading
recorded in `spikes/rate-limit-core/scenarios.md` §7 B3: a request
timestamp rounds up to the bucket end, while the history entry itself
is never quantized. Two further boundary conventions are pinned by B3's
ratified amendment (August 15, 2026, with the §7.4 gate adoption):
buckets are half-open — an arrival exactly on a grid point takes the
full following bucket — and expiry is exclusive — a hit whose
adversarial expiry equals an arrival instant is no longer counted at
that arrival. N25's immediate one-request/one-increment observation
is the constraint on the never-quantized-entry choice. All of these
are explicit model choices, not claims that the server implements
those exact boundary semantics. (Both added conventions transcribed
August 15, 2026, repairing the spike's final-audit finding SD-R8-F19;
the §7.4 band tables are sensitive to the expiry convention by ±1 ms
at their edges, while N13's one-second buffer dwarfs the slop.)

**N32. Reprioritization is cheap in the rate-limit-core actor shape and
was not cheap in the superseded C++ coroutine/facade shape; the R7/D6
“not cheap later” warning does not carry over unchanged.** [SPIKE +
CODE — Confirmed structurally on `spike/rate-limit-core`, August 12,
2026]
In the C++ shape, the stop token is per update, so per-entry
cancellation did not exist and reordering first required entry identity.
The Rust actor already has that identity: `RequestId`, positional removal
in `Command::Cancel`, and a dispatch loop whose ordinary GET selection
reads and pops only `queue.front()`, while probe writer selection —
`Actor::schedule` via `pending_probe()` — scans the whole deque for a
queued unknown endpoint, in `spikes/rate-limit-core/src/actor.rs`
(mechanism narrowed August 15, 2026, repairing the spike's final-audit
finding SD-R8-F20; the earlier front-only wording overstated it). FIFO
emerges from append-at-back/take-from-front rather than being assumed,
and the actor already dispatches out of arrival order for writer
preference — that out-of-order dispatch is exactly the deque scan. The
single-deque conclusion stands with the mechanism narrowed.
Reordering is therefore `remove(pos) + insert(pos)`; the expensive part
is specifying the contract because D5's “no lane starvation” clause does
not define a priority rule. This is structural evidence for the spike
charter's thesis that queue-as-data selects the actor shape.

N32's tripwire is the actor's one global deque. If the actor fans out
into per-policy lanes, “reorder to position N” loses a single meaning
and cross-lane priority becomes a design decision; that is when N32 must
be revisited. The comparison also intentionally preserves its superseded
C++ premise: `docs/design/network-redesign.md` R7/D6 and
`docs/design/network-redesign-reviews.md` (July 19 errata, the removed
stale cancel-and-resubmit reprioritization claim). If those C++ documents
are retired or the spike is hoisted into its own repository, carry this
contrast with N32 so the old warning cannot outlive the shape that made
it true.

**N33. The OAuth token endpoint is rate-limited under its own
IP-scoped policy; the authorize page is browser-only.** [OBS —
Confirmed], August 16, 2026: one deliberate `invalid_grant` POST,
then a full real login cycle (browser authorize → code exchange → one
refresh), using the client's registered parameters (client_id
`acquisition`, PKCE S256, versioned User-Agent, loopback
`/auth/path-of-exile` callback). Findings:

- `POST /oauth/token` answers with the standard header set: policy
  `token-request-limit`, rules `Ip`, limits `60:30:30` (one triplet —
  no initial/sustained pair). No Account or Client rule: token
  requests are counted per IP, before authentication.
- Both grant types share the one counter: the authorization_code
  exchange reported state `1:30:0` and the refresh_token grant
  immediately after reported `2:30:0`. The standalone `invalid_grant`
  probe reported `1:30:0` on its HTTP 400 — error responses carry the
  full header set and count against the limit (consistent with N25's
  post-increment behavior; note a 400 here also spends the separate
  invalid-request budget, N27).
- All token-endpoint responses came via Cloudflare (`server:
  cloudflare`, `cf-ray` present), so layer-1 concerns (N2/N3) apply
  to token traffic too.
- Access tokens: `expires_in` 36000 (10 hours). Refresh tokens
  **rotate on every refresh grant** — a new refresh token is returned
  and must be persisted each time. (Whether the superseded token
  remains valid was not probed.)
- The granted scope string can come back reordered relative to the
  request (`account:leagues account:characters account:stashes`) —
  compare scopes as a set, not a string.
- `GET /oauth/authorize` from a non-browser client (correct UA,
  single request, not retried) returns a Cloudflare 403 with no
  rate-limit headers, while the same URL in a real browser proceeds
  normally. Whatever rate-limit regime the authorize page has is
  unobservable headlessly and irrelevant to the client, which only
  ever opens that URL in the user's browser.

Consequence for Appendix A's bypass list: the current client's
oauth/token bypass is benign only because token traffic is rare (a
handful of requests per 10-hour token lifetime), not because the
endpoint is unlimited. A design that owns token traffic should track
`token-request-limit` like any other policy — the headers parse
identically.

### Live-testing claims (August 24, 2026)

Observed while soaking the Rust daemon against the live API on branch
`spikes/rust-playground`; the run is recorded as rung 8 in that branch's
`LIVE-TESTING.md`. Journal and daemon log retained in that branch's
`runs/2026-08-23-r8/`.

**N34. A 401 from an expired access token carries no rate-limit headers
at all — not the policy, not the rules, not the state.** [OBSERVED —
Confirmed August 23, 2026]
Three GET `/character` requests with an expired bearer token, ten
minutes apart, each returned `401 Unauthorized` with body
`{"error":"invalid_token","error_description":"The access token provided
is invalid or has expired"}` and an empty header set — the send journal
recorded `rate: {}` for all three. The next request after a refresh
returned the usual `character-list-request-limit` headers, so the route
itself was unaffected.

Two consequences. A limiter that maintains its window state from
response headers learns nothing from a 401 and must carry its own
accounting forward across one, rather than treating the absent headers
as a cleared window. And by N27 the invalid-request budget includes
every 4xx, so a 401 spends that budget against an undocumented
threshold while returning nothing that would let a client detect the
cost — which is what makes a timed stream of 401s (a daemon that
believes an expired token is still valid) more dangerous than its
request count suggests. Whether GGG also counts a 401 against the
route's own policy counter is Q11.

### Live-testing claims — rung 10 (August 25, 2026)

Observed while the Rust daemon on branch `spikes/rust-playground` pulled
the full Standard stash (322 tabs, 18 072 items) against the live API;
the runs are recorded as rung 10 in that branch's `LIVE-TESTING.md`.
Journals, daemon logs, and the 503 body are retained in that branch's
`runs/2026-08-24-r10/`, `runs/2026-08-24-r10b/`, and
`runs/2026-08-25-r10c/` (gitignored, on disk).

**N35. The origin can answer a compliant request with an HTTP 503 that
carries no rate-limit headers and is not Cloudflare-shaped.** [OBSERVED
— High; one occurrence, August 25, 2026]
At 2026-08-25T02:54:04Z, GET `/stash/Standard/7b05e6f78d` returned
`503 Service Unavailable` with no `X-Rate-Limit-*` headers at all (the
send journal recorded `rate: {}`) and an HTML body `503 Service
Temporarily Unavailable` signed `openresty` — no `cloudflare` string,
no Ray ID, no error 1015 (`runs/2026-08-24-r10/job-243-503.json` holds
the body). The account was at 0 hits in both `stash-request-limit`
windows: it was the first send after a 343 s hold, and the previous
response had read `15:10:0,30:300:0`. The same tab, in the same
position (first send after a hold), answered 200 on the two later runs
of the same pull, so the 503 was transient, not tab-specific.

This extends the recognition surface of N3 and N28: a 5xx exists that
is neither a Cloudflare block nor a policy 429, so a client cannot treat
"5xx without rate-limit headers" as layer-1 evidence. As with N34, a
limiter fed from response headers learns nothing from it and must carry
its own accounting forward. Whether the rate-limit middleware counted
the request is unknown — there were no headers to say — so the
conservative reading is that it did (the spike counts it). Whether a
503 spends the invalid-request budget of N27 is unknown; that budget is
documented as 4xx-only.

**N36. `veiledMods` is volatile: its placeholder ids are re-randomized
per fetch, so the field differs between two pulls of an unchanged
stash.** [OBSERVED — High; one pair of samples, August 25, 2026]
Two full pulls of the same 322-tab Standard stash, at
2026-08-25T04:37Z and 2026-08-25T12:20Z with nothing touched in between,
differed in exactly one item field across the 18 072 items in each:
`veiledMods` on 10 items, with values such as `["Prefix04","Suffix06"]`
→ `["Prefix03","Suffix03"]` and `["Prefix06"]` → `["Prefix01"]`. No
other field on any item changed, and no tab or item was added, removed,
or moved. Snapshots: the branch's `runs/2026-08-24-r10b/` and
`runs/2026-08-25-r10c/` (the snapshot JSON files themselves live under
`~/.local/share/acquisition-playground/snapshots/ggg/Standard/`).

Consequence: a consumer that diffs two snapshots to detect stash changes
must ignore `veiledMods`, or it reports phantom changes on every pull;
the spike's pull diff now does so. More generally, "the payload differs"
is not evidence that the stash changed, and any future change-detection
or conditional-fetch design should assume other fields may prove
volatile until a wider sample says otherwise.

**N37. `Account`-scoped rules count per account: two accounts on one
machine and one IP do not share policy counters.** [OBSERVED — High;
one run of two accounts, August 30, 2026]
Two daemons, each logged into a different account, on one machine
(spike rung 11; `spikes/rust-playground/LIVE-TESTING.md` run ledger,
`runs/2026-08-30-r11/`). Account A's counted GET on
`character-list-request-limit` read `1:10:0,1:300:0`; account B's HEAD
probe on the same policy **4.1 s later** reported `0:10:0,0:300:0`, and
B's GET was answered `1:10:0,1:300:0`. Then both daemons sent a GET
**28 ms apart**; each was answered `1:10:0,2:300:0` — its own account's
second hit in the long window, nothing from the other account. The
same run's two code exchanges were 31 s apart, so `token-request-limit`
(Ip-scoped, N33) was not sampled across accounts.

Consequence: the rate-limit layer (layer 2) gives multiple accounts on
one machine nothing to contend over; what they share is layer 1
(Cloudflare, per IP) and the Ip-scoped token policy. A client that
holds several accounts therefore needs its limiter keyed by
`(account, policy)` for `Account` rules and by policy alone for `Ip`
rules — and, because one account's response overwrites nothing of
another's, a limiter keyed by policy alone would pace the second
account from the first's counters (a flood path when both are live).
The spike's daemon is one process with many sessions for the layer-1
reason: two processes each bounding their own concurrency are four
sends in flight to Cloudflare.

**N38. `GET /profile` answers 200 with no `X-Rate-Limit-*` headers at
all; `HEAD /profile` is answered 403.** [OBSERVED — High; three GET
samples and one HEAD, August 30, 2026]
Fresh daemons with a valid bearer (scope `account:profile` granted):
`HEAD /profile` → 403 (the first sample; response headers were not yet
logged, so the shape is unrecorded). `GET /profile` → 200 in 136 ms
with the account JSON (`uuid`, `name`, `realm`, …) and **no rate-limit
header of any kind** (send journal `rate: {}`), three times on three
daemons. Every other API endpoint sampled answers HEAD 204 or 200 with
the full policy set.

**GGG's answer (Q12, 2026-08-30): `/profile` is not rate limited at
present.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed; GGG's web developer to the owner,
2026-08-30] There is no hidden policy; the missing headers reflect the
truth. "At present"
is load-bearing: this can change without notice, and strict observation
already covers that arm — a policy that ever appears in headers is
learned and enforced.

Consequence: a limiter that treats "2xx without a policy header" as a
protocol failure (the strict reading N33 justified) cannot use this
endpoint. The spike declares `/profile` policyless per route — now
confirmed rather than merely accepted: paced by the send gate alone
(layer 1 applies regardless of GGG's answer), called at most once per
login for the `uuid`. The declaration stays until GGG adds headers, at
which point strict observation takes over and the declaration is
deleted.

**N39. `GET /account/leagues` is `league-request-limit`, `Account`,
`5:10:60, 10:60:300` — and its HEAD is counted.** [OBSERVED — High;
one sample, August 30, 2026]
`HEAD /account/leagues` was answered **200** (the free HEADs of N24
answer 204) with the full policy set and state `1:10:0,1:60:0` — the
HEAD itself was the hit; the GET 48 ms later read `2:10:0,2:60:0`.
`GET /league` (the public league list) requires `service:leagues`
(`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer … error="insufficient_scope"`); the
account's leagues are `/account/leagues[/{realm}]` under
`account:leagues`.

**GGG's answer (Q12, 2026-08-30): the counted HEAD is a defect; GGG
will correct it in a future release.** [GGG-EMAIL — Confirmed; GGG's
web developer to the owner, 2026-08-30] No release or date named. Until the fix is
*observed* live (a HEAD answered 204 and uncounted, the N24 pattern),
the current behavior stands and clients must treat the HEAD as
counted — the correction is a promise, not an observation, and this
document ranks observation first.

Consequence: N24's uncounted HEAD is a property of particular
endpoints, not of the API; a client must not assume a probe is free on
an endpoint it has not sampled. Pacing is unaffected — the state
headers are post-increment and include the HEAD's hit — but a probe
there is a wasted hit, so the spike does not probe this route and lets
the first GET teach the policy; when GGG's fix is observed, the
no-probe declaration can be deleted and the probe restored (regaining
learn-before-first-counted-send on this route). One sample; the
200-vs-204 status is a candidate tell for "counted HEAD" until more
endpoints say otherwise.

**N40. `GET /character/{name}` is `character-request-limit`,
`Account`, `5:10:60, 30:300:300`, with a free HEAD.** [OBSERVED —
High; one sample, August 30, 2026]
Confirms the C++ capture's shape exactly: HEAD 204 with
`0:10:0,0:300:0`, GET 200 with `1:10:0,1:300:0`, 180 ms end to end.
Recorded as the ordinary pattern against which N38 and N39 are the
exceptions.

### Characters and PoE2 claims (September 2, 2026)

Source for all five: the Rust spike's characters rung
(`spikes/rust-playground/LIVE-TESTING.md`, run ledger rows dated
2026-09-02; journals and bodies under `runs/2026-09-02-characters/`,
`runs/2026-09-02-tracer-150553/`, `-154145/`, `-160139/`, `-161419/`).
One account (`GERWARIC#7694`), one machine, rails on, every probe at 0
hits, zero non-2xx across the day.

**N41. The PoE2 character endpoints carry their own policies —
`character-list-request-limit-poe2` and `character-request-limit-poe2`
— with pc's windows, `Account` rules, and a free HEAD.** [OBSERVED —
Confirmed; four fresh daemons, September 2, 2026]
`HEAD /character/poe2` → 204, uncounted (`0:10:0,0:300:0` after it),
policy `character-list-request-limit-poe2`, `Account`,
`2:10:60, 5:300:300`; `GET /character/poe2` → 200, `1:10:0,1:300:0`.
`HEAD /character/poe2/{name}` → 204, uncounted, policy
`character-request-limit-poe2`, `Account`, `5:10:60, 30:300:300`; the
GETs that followed read `1:10:0` … `5:10:0`. The names differ from
the pc policies of N23 by the `-poe2` suffix only; the windows are
identical. By N6 (same name shares state, different name does not)
the pc and PoE2 counters are separate: a client can list or fetch on
both realms without one realm's hits pacing the other's. The realm
segment sits in the path (`/character/poe2`, `/character/poe2/{name}`);
the pc routes are the unsuffixed ones, and the two are distinct routes
for probing (one HEAD each per daemon lifetime).

Consequence: a limiter that keys policy state by the reported name
(N6, the spike's `ratelimit.rs`) needs nothing new; one that assumed
"character-list-request-limit" for every realm would under-count
nothing but would pace PoE2 sends against pc's counters, wasting
capacity. N24's free-HEAD pattern holds on both PoE2 routes (against
N39's counted HEAD on `/account/leagues`).

**N42. The character list is per realm and reports `realm` as
`"poe2"` for PoE2 characters; the pc list omits them.** [OBSERVED —
High; two pc listings and two PoE2 listings, September 2, 2026]
`GET /character` returned 59 entries, every one `realm: "pc"`;
`GET /character/poe2` returned 6, every one `realm: "poe2"`; no id or
name appeared in both. The documented `Character.realm` enumeration
(`pc | xbox | sony`) is incomplete — PoE2 characters report `poe2`,
matching the path segment. Each entry carries exactly
`class current experience id league level name realm` on both realms:
`id` is the 64-hex form and equals the fetched body's `id`; one entry
is `current: true`; **no `deleted` or `expired` flag appeared on any
entry**, including characters in ended leagues (Ancestors, Phrecia
2.0, an SSF gauntlet event, `Runes of Aldur`), so the documented
optional flags are not how ended-league characters are marked — the
league name is.

Consequence: a client keyed by name across realms will collide (PoE1
and PoE2 share league names and could share character names); the
spike keys characters by `id` and stores the *request's* realm beside
the body's. A "which characters are gone" question cannot be answered
from flags — only a listing that no longer names the id says so.

**N43. PoE2 items carry `realm: "poe2"`; pc items carry no `realm`
field. A PoE2 character body has `equipment`, `jewels`, and `skills`
(no `inventory`), and its skill-panel gems have ids and slot-named
`inventoryId`s.** [OBSERVED — High; five PoE2 bodies and 42 pc bodies,
September 2, 2026]
All items in the five PoE2 bodies carry `realm: "poe2"`; none of the
1,962 items lifted from pc bodies carry `realm` at all. Every item on
both realms carries `frameTypeId` (a string: `Gem`, `Currency`,
`Magic`, …) beside the deprecated numeric `frameType`. PoE2 bodies
report `metadata.version` `4.5.4f` (pc: `3.29.3`). `skills` entries
that are real gems have ids and `inventoryId` `DefaultAttackSkills`
(the weapon's default attack, e.g. `Bow Shot`) or `SkillSlots`;
supports socketed into them have ids and no `inventoryId`. PoE1's
animate-guardian gear arrives as its own `guardian` array whose
entries carry the character's own slot names as `inventoryId`
(`Helm`, `BodyArmour`, `Gloves`, `Boots`, `Weapon`, `x`/`y` 0) — an
item's json cannot say which array it came from. Ten of 41 pc
Standard characters (levels 86–100) answered with empty `equipment`,
`inventory`, and `jewels` — stripped characters are an ordinary body,
not an error.

**N44. An item-granted skill has no `id` — the documented-optional
`Item.id`, observed. A PoE2 weapon or shield that grants a skill
carries it as an id-less gem in its own `socketedItems`, the identical
object is repeated as `skills[0]`, and a support socketed into the
granted skill is id-less too.** [OBSERVED — Confirmed; four bodies
twice, September 2, 2026]
Rattling Sceptre → `Skeletal Warrior` (with a player-socketed `Meat
Shield I` support, also id-less, under it), Attuned Wand → `Mana
Drain`, Withered Wand → `Chaos Bolt`, Splintered Tower Shield → `Raise
Shield`. In each body the host item's `sockets` is `[]` and its
`socketedItems` holds the granted skill (`frameTypeId: "Gem"`,
`frameType: 4`, `support: false`, its own `sockets` and
`socketedItems`); `skills[0]` is deep-equal to that object and has no
`inventoryId`. Nothing else in any body lacked an id: a `Desert Rune`
socketed in a focus (`frameTypeId: "Currency"`, `sockets[].type`
`rune`) has one; a Crude Bow grants nothing and its character's body
was fully id-bearing. The four bodies were refused by the spike's
store on first contact for exactly this and are kept verbatim
(`refused` rows 1–4).

Consequence: an ingest that requires an id on every item cannot land a
PoE2 character wielding a granting weapon. The spike's ruling
(2026-09-02): a granted skill is a property of its host, never an item
fact — its subtree stays in the host's json and, under `skills`, in
the envelope, counted and never lifted; every other id-less shape is
still refused. Whether GGG ever assigns ids to granted skills is
unknown; if it does, the shape simply stops matching and the entries
become ordinary socketed gems.

**N45. Two policies on one account pace independently, and a hold
ends when the window expires, not at a fixed length.** [OBSERVED —
High; one 112-request cycle, September 2, 2026]
A cycle of 69 `stash-request-limit` GETs and 41
`character-request-limit` GETs ran side by side from one daemon: the
stash facet held ~15 s after 15 and ~343 s after 30 and 60; the
character facet held ~15 s after every 5 (its short window is 5 per
10 s) and **280 s** after its 30th — its 300 s window had opened at
its first GET, about a minute before the 30th, so the wait was the
remainder. The cycle lasted as long as the longer facet (~13 min), not
the sum. Extends N26 (pacing arithmetic exact) to two concurrent
policies and bounds the "~343 s" figure of the spike's estimates as
the worst case (a window filled at once), not a constant.

## Open questions

- **Q1. HEAD sanction verbatim. RESOLVED July 18, 2026** — Tom
  retrieved the thread (Nov 2023 – Jul 2024). Chronology and verbatim
  quotes are captured in N16; consequences split into N17 (first
  reporter), N20 (degraded-HEAD handling), and the upgraded N2
  (incident details from GGG's own report).
- **Q2. Auth-mode topology. LARGELY RESOLVED July 18, 2026** (N23):
  under OAuth, API rules are Account-scoped (no Client rule); the
  POESESSID legacy endpoint has its own policy with Account+Ip rules.
  Residual: whether the API policies look different under any other
  auth arrangement is untested but no longer load-bearing.
- **Q3. HEAD mechanics. LARGELY RESOLVED July 18, 2026** (N24): full
  header sets confirmed on all five endpoints (Dec 2023 fix shipped);
  HEADs do not appear to increment counters (the one anomalous-looking
  state value was confirmed as cross-session residue). **Residual
  closed July 18, 2026:** the degraded-HEAD design decision is made in
  `docs/design/network-redesign.md` (D4 — clean setup failure with a
  cooldown; the earlier discovery-fallback design was deleted in the
  July 19 simplification). Note the previously recorded "today" behavior was wrong
  — a degraded reply is undefined behavior in the current parser, not
  unpaced running (see the N20 correction).
- **Q4. Initial-vs-sustained classification.** The client classifies a
  limit as initial (5s bucket) vs sustained (60s bucket) by `period <=
  75s`. Provenance (Tom, July 2026): the cutoff came from eyeballing
  the actual policy definitions, which have not changed since first
  observed (N9 note) — calibrated to reality, but an absolute cutoff
  misclassifies if definitions ever shift (a 60s-period sustained
  limit would be under-padded → violations). Untested alternative
  (Tom's idea; he may have tried it and forgotten): classify
  *relatively* — pair up rules that differ only in period; the shorter
  of the pair is the initial limit, the longer is sustained. Captured
  policy definitions would let us evaluate both against the real
  shapes. **Sharpened July 18, 2026 (N23): the danger case is live.**
  `stash-list-request-limit`'s sustained rule is `30:60:300` — a
  60-second period, classified as *initial* (5s bucket) by the 75s
  cutoff. If GGG's "1 minute intervals for the sustained limit" (N12)
  applies to that rule, it is under-padded by 55s, and it is a prime
  suspect for the historically unexplained intermittent violations
  (N15). Not yet observed failing (the rule never saturated in the
  first capture); saturating stash-list — e.g. many rapid manual
  refreshes — would test it, but see the no-active-probing
  constraint. **Tom's hypothesis (July 18, 2026) [HYP]:**
  classification is *positional* — when a rule carries two
  `hits:period:restriction` triplets, the first is the initial limit
  (5s bucket) and the second is the sustained limit (60s bucket).
  This needs no period arithmetic, matches every rule in the first
  capture (shorter period always listed first, N23), and classifies
  the stash-list danger case conservatively where the 75s cutoff does
  not. Strictly safer than the cutoff on all observed data; still
  worth confirming with GGG alongside the bucket-tier question.
- **Q5. Current live violation rate.** With bucket-padded pacing, are
  violations actually zero in real sessions? If not, under what
  conditions? (Instrumented sessions, especially at saturation on the
  many-tab account.) First data point (July 18, 2026): a full
  24-minute saturated refresh, zero violations.
- **Q6. What does the reported state reflect at response time?
  LARGELY RESOLVED July 18, 2026** (N25): post-increment, 1:1 with
  requests, no backwards jumps, clean reset after the padded wait.
  Residual: quantization is only observable at margins tighter than
  the full bucket padding, so N25 cannot rule it out — it just
  confirms the padded regime is safe.
- **Q7. Cloudflare incident reconstruction.** Magnitude and shape now
  known from GGG's own report (N2): over a thousand HEADs in one
  minute, ~20+ repeats per tab. Still unknown, from the user's side:
  presentation (1015 page?), duration, and scope (API only, or
  website/game too). Deliberately *not* to be re-established
  experimentally (N4); memory and any surviving reports are the only
  sources.
- **Q8. What does "frequently" mean for revocation (N10)?** Probably
  unanswerable except by asking GGG; relevant to how much residual
  violation rate (Q5) is tolerable.
- **Q9. Is `Retry-After` sufficient?** Tom is almost certain it is
  *not* — bucket padding is needed on top (N19; the retry delay was
  one of the variables in his launch-window tuning). Design should
  assume N19; captures of any live 429 (retry timing vs outcome) would
  confirm it. (F57's wedge has hidden the answer so far — the retried
  request's outcome was never observed by the caller.)
- **Q10. Scope: legacy endpoints. LARGELY RESOLVED July 18, 2026** —
  the facts are recorded as N21/N22: both regimes are real
  rate-limited traffic the client carries, and their auth exclusivity
  (bearer tokens actively break both) is part of why the current
  design centralizes scheduling in the limiter. What remains of Q10:
  (a) research side — capture the legacy endpoint's policy identity
  and, if needed, ask GGG for its bucket resolutions (N21c); (b)
  design side — decide whether the redesign *coordinates* legacy and
  forum traffic with API traffic (they share the IP, hence layer 1)
  or merely tolerates them as-is.

- **Q11. Does a 401 count against the route's policy counter?** —
  N34 establishes that a 401 returns no rate-limit headers, so the
  question cannot be answered from the failing response itself. The
  August 23 observation is inconclusive: the first successful request
  after the three 401s came 600 s later, outside the 300 s window, and
  reported `1:300:0` — consistent with either answer. Resolvable
  cheaply the next time a 401 occurs by issuing one valid request
  inside the shorter window and reading its state, but not worth
  provoking deliberately; N27's invalid-request budget makes 401s
  costly independently of the answer.

---
- **Q12. Is `/profile` rate-limited, and is the counted HEAD on
  `/account/leagues` intended? ANSWERED 2026-08-30** (same day, GGG's
  web developer): `/profile` is **not rate limited at present** (N38 —
  the policyless declaration is confirmed, kept until headers ever
  appear), and the counted HEAD on `/account/leagues` **will be
  corrected in a future release** (N39 — treat as counted until the
  free HEAD is observed; then delete the no-probe declaration and
  restore the probe). Neither answer changes any code today.

## Instrumentation

The current logs cannot answer the open questions: raw
`X-Rate-Limit-*` headers are logged only once per endpoint (initial
HEAD probe, debug level), steady-state replies never log raw headers,
per-request send timestamps are trace-only, and non-violating state
evolution is invisible above trace.

**Implemented July 18, 2026** (`src/ratelimit/networkcapture.h/.cpp`,
pinned by `tests/tst_networkcapture.cpp`): a capture-only instrument —
it observes traffic and never influences it. Durable, off by default;
enable with `network_capture_enabled=true` in `settings.ini`. Writes
`network-capture.jsonl` in the data directory (20 MB cap, one rotated
`.1` backup, flushed per record so a crash loses nothing). One JSON
object per line, `v` = schema version (currently 1):

- `kind: "reply"` — every exchange through a `RateLimitManager`,
  including network failures and 429s: policy, endpoint, request id,
  URL, `scheduled` (the computed next-safe-send, buffers included;
  updated to the intended retry time on a Retry-After retry), `sent`
  and `received` (local, ms), HTTP `status`, `error`/`error_string`
  when present, and a `headers` object with the verbatim
  `x-rate-limit-*`, `retry-after`, and `date` values (names
  lowercased — Qt normalizes header case anyway; values verbatim).
- `kind: "head"` — every setup probe, recorded *before* validation so
  degraded HEAD replies (N20) are captured: endpoint, URL, status,
  error, headers.

Every normal refresh session with the setting on becomes research
data. Saturation sessions on a many-tab account are the most valuable
(that is where pacing decisions actually bind). Captures from both
auth modes serve Q2; a shop stash-index run captures the legacy
endpoint's policy identity (N21c).

## Research method constraints

- **No active probing of limits.** Provoking 429s burns layer-4
  goodwill (N10) with a registered client id shared by all users;
  probing layer 1 risks users' IPs (N2). Passive observation of normal
  usage, plus GGG support's explicitly offered ask-us channel (N14),
  are the sanctioned instruments.
- **Community prior art is calibration, not ground truth** (N17).
  A bounded sweep of other clients' rate-limit code and issues may
  corroborate bucket-like anomalies or Cloudflare encounters; do it
  after the email archaeology and first captures, not before.

## Appendix A — What the current client does (evidence, July 17, 2026)

Condensed factual map; anchors are to code as of branch
`network-redesign` — named `fix-f57-f59-ratelimit-retry` until the
July 19 rename (docs-only commits over `03b15a3`).

**Rate-limited endpoints** (via `RateLimiter::Submit`, keyed by
endpoint label, managers deduplicated by policy name):

| Label | URL | Issued from |
|---|---|---|
| `List Stashes` | `api.pathofexile.com/stash[/{realm}]/{league}` | `ItemsManagerWorker::SubmitStashListRequest` |
| `List Characters` | `api.pathofexile.com/character[/{realm}]` | `SubmitCharacterListRequest` |
| `Get Stash` | `api.pathofexile.com/stash[/{realm}]/{league}/{id}[/{sub}]` | `ProcessTab` / folder-children path |
| `Get Character` | `api.pathofexile.com/character[/{realm}]/{name}` | `OnCharacterListReceived` |
| (URL as key) | `www.pathofexile.com/character-window/get-stash-items?...` | `Shop::UpdateStashIndex` (POESESSID cookie; no bearer) |

All with a 10s transfer timeout and a versioned `User-Agent`.

**Bypassing the rate limiter entirely:** league list (login), OAuth
authorize/token (but see N33 — the token endpoint does carry a
rate-limit policy), forum-shop GET/POST (`edit-thread`, 300s timeout,
rate limiting detected by scraping "You must wait (\d+) seconds." from
HTML), RePoE static files, GitHub release check, poecdn images, imgur
upload, Sentry.

**Concurrency, today:** strictly serial twice over. Each
`RateLimitManager` sends one request at a time per policy; on top of
that, `ItemsManagerWorker` (since `ea9dd95`, v0.17.0) keeps one item
request in flight globally and its queue is stashes-first — the F56
starvation. Net effect: at most one API request in flight at any
moment, ever (which incidentally satisfies N18 and keeps bursts at 1).

**Pacing arithmetic** (`RateLimitPolicy::GetNextSafeSend`): if any
rule's state has `current-hits >= max-hits`, look back `max_hits`
events in that manager's reply history; for that event take
`max(request_time, received_time, server Date)`; add the rule's period;
add the bucket (5s if period ≤ 75s, else 60s) plus 1s buffer; next send
is the max over all saturated rules. Non-saturated sends get a 100ms
buffer. A 1s global minimum-interval guard exists but is dead code
(`last_send` never assigned — F58).

**429 handling:** on 429 with `Retry-After`, the manager waits and
resends — but the caller's `RateLimitedReply` is destroyed by the
nulling line in `ReceiveReply`, so the caller never hears the retry's
outcome (F57: worker counters never reconcile; update wedges until
restart). On 429 without `Retry-After`: logged, no retry. Violations
increment a session counter (`RateLimiter::OnViolation`) and dump
policy history at error level.

**HEAD setup:** first request to an unknown endpoint triggers a HEAD
probe, blocking in a nested event loop (F5/N18); non-2xx or missing
`X-Rate-Limit-Policy` on the probe is fatal to the app.

**Logging gaps for research:** see Instrumentation plan above.
