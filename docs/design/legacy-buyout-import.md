# Legacy Buyout Import — Design

Status: revised August 14, 2026, after the round-1 review and the UX
discussion (plan/apply split agreed; not yet built). The original tracer
bullet is implemented (c687409f). Deliberately minimal — this is not a
frozen spec. Evidence: `legacy-buyout-import-investigation.md`; review
findings cited as `R1-*` from `legacy-buyout-import-reviews.md`.

## Goal

Let a user recover buyouts from a pre-0.16 database file into the current
`item_buyouts` / `location_buyouts` store, keyed on GGG ids.

## Shape: plan, then apply

The import splits into two phases around an editable plan file. The plan
file is simultaneously the dry run, the audit trail, and the control
surface — it replaces policy decisions we would otherwise have to
hardcode blind (R1-5, R1-7) with prefilled rows the user can flip.

**Plan**: read the legacy file, match buyouts to GGG ids, consult the
*current* userstore (existing buyouts, current tab names, current
characters), and produce a plan. The user sees one dialog:

> Matched N of M buyouts (X ambiguous, Y orphaned).
> [Import now]  [Save plan for review…]

"Import now" runs apply immediately with the prefilled defaults and still
writes the plan file next to the logs (`buyout-import-<timestamp>.xlsx`)
as the audit record. "Save plan…" lets the user edit it in a spreadsheet
and later run "Import buyout plan…" to apply it.

**Apply**: execute the plan's `action = import` rows. Apply validates
consistency only — known currency/type/source tags, numeric values,
non-empty ids, valid action — it does not re-match. An orphaned row
becomes importable if the user fills in an item id by hand.

## Plan file format

XLSX via QXlsx (MIT, fetched by CMake like other third-party code).
Chosen over CSV deliberately: typed cells (prices stay numbers, ids stay
strings), no locale decimal/delimiter/encoding hazards, dropdown
validation, and a metadata sheet. This format is the output of a legacy
import and an input to apply — it is **not** a public bulk-price-editing
interface, and we make no compatibility promises beyond the import flow.

- Sheet `plan`: one row per legacy buyout target. Columns are located by
  header name, never by position. Roughly: `action` (dropdown:
  import/skip), `reason` (matched / ambiguous-k-of-n / orphaned /
  inherited / existing-manual / needs-attention / …), the buyout fields
  (`value`, `currency`, `type`, `source`, `inherited`), the target
  (`item_id`, `location_id`, `location_type`), context for humans
  (`item_name`, `old_tab_label`, `current_tab_name`), and provenance
  (`legacy_hash`, `existing_value`, `existing_source`).
- Sheet `meta`: format version, source file path, export timestamp,
  source db_version. Apply checks the version stamp.

## Prefill defaults (replacing hardcoded policy)

- Inherited legacy buyouts → `skip` (reason `inherited`): they were
  derived from tab buyouts, which import separately; imported-as-is they
  are destroyed by the next `PropagateTabBuyouts` (R1-5).
- Target already has a MANUAL row → `skip` (reason `existing-manual`):
  never silently clobber user-authored current data (R1-7, following the
  `MigrateItem` precedent).
- Target has a non-MANUAL (auto-generated) row → `import`: the legacy
  price outranks a machine-derived one (R1-7).
- Ambiguous hash (identical items / duplicate labels) → `import` to all
  matching targets, flagged `ambiguous-k-of-n`; this replicates what old
  acquisition displayed.
- Orphaned → listed with empty `item_id`, `action = skip`.

## Matching rules

- **Stash ids**: legacy-API-era files carry 64-hex stash ids in the tabs
  blob; only the non-OAuth API ever returned those, so ids longer than
  10 chars are confidently truncated to their first 10 (the old
  `ItemLocation::FixUid` rule, which `items.loc` and master's
  `ItemLocation::id()` both already use). A truncated id that fails the
  cross-checks (present among the old file's `items.loc` keys; ideally in
  the current `stashes` table) flags that row `needs-attention` rather
  than aborting the import (R1-2).
- **Tab labels**: read from `n` with `name` as fallback (legacy-API tab
  JSON has no `name`; R1-3). The label is only the join key *within* the
  old file (legacy `tab_buyouts` are label-keyed); from there everything
  rides the unique id, which survives renames. The plan shows both
  `old_tab_label` and `current_tab_name` so the user can sanity-check.
- **Characters**, in fallback order (R1-9): (1) the old file's character
  `id` when present; (2) name match against current userstore
  characters; (3) equipped-item search — if a current character's
  `json_data` items include any of the old character's item ids, propose
  that character with reason `character-matched-by-items` for the user
  to confirm in the plan; (4) orphan. The search simply uses whatever
  the userstore currently holds — no fetch-state checks (see
  precondition below).

## Apply mechanics

- The save loops run inside a single `m_db.transaction()`/`commit()`
  (the `userstore.cpp` migrate pattern) with one hoisted prepared
  statement per loop, behind a wait cursor (R1-10).
- Write errors are counted separately from skips, recorded per row, and
  fail the report loudly — a failed import must be distinguishable from
  an idempotent re-run (R1-4).
- After a successful apply, the import is treated like any other buyout
  update: propagate tab buyouts, restore refresh-lock state, expire shop
  data — the same path `OnBuyoutChange` takes (R1-8).

## Parse leniency

Item granularity, not row granularity (R1-6): items rows are parsed
per element (e.g. `std::vector<glz::raw_json>`, then per-item
conversion), so one malformed 2014-era item flags that item, not an
entire stash tab. The same guard applies to the `buyouts`/`tab_buyouts`
blobs: a partial parse must not masquerade as a complete one.

## Precondition: a recent full refresh

Matching quality depends on the current userstore holding freshly
refreshed stashes and characters. This is deliberately the user's
responsibility, not the code's: the dialog carries a warning ("import
works best immediately after a full refresh of stashes and characters"),
and staleness is self-evident in the plan (empty current-name columns,
unmatched characters). No enforcement, no fetch-state gating. Optionally
the dialog may display the newest `json_fetched_at` as a nudge.

## Simplifying assumptions, on purpose

- **GGG ids are persistent.** Validated at 1170/1171 over 14 months.
- **db_version 4 and 5 only** (5 is master's harmless re-stamp of a v4
  file — R1-1, fixed). Files at `<4` are refused with a clear message
  (add the prefixed-hash variant later if anyone hits it).

## Deferred (iterate after this works)

- Automatic candidate discovery across `data/`, `data-backup-*/`,
  `m_data_save*/`, with league/count/mtime shown per candidate.
- db_version <4 hash variant.
- A startup nudge when unimported legacy buyouts are detected.
- Deleting the superseded live-hash migration machinery
  (`ItemsManager::MigrateBuyouts`, `Item::hash_v4`/`old_hash`,
  `ItemLocation::GetLegacyHash`) — closes F54, retires the F51
  constraint. Do this only once the importer has proven itself in a
  release.
